          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">All fees listed in the Fee Schedule are in Great British Pounds Sterling, and are inclusive of VAT, unless stated otherwise.  The Fee Schedule may vary in the future.  The Fee Schedule in effect at the time of payment will govern the payment.  Annual fees are payable in advance on the date on which you sign up for the Service and on the same date each year thereafter.  The Fee Schedule in effect on the date on which an annual fee is due will govern the annual fee.  All fees are payable upon demand.  By listing an Organisation on the Site, you authorise Payzip to collect payment via direct debit or, where applicable, to debit your Payzip Organisation account, for all and any amounts due in the manner and at the times set out in the Fee Schedule.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">The Organisation fees are subject to VAT where applicable and will be paid by the Organisation at the time of payment of the corresponding fees.</li>

        <ul role="list" class="list-2">
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">The amount due and payable to each Organisation under this agreement at any time shall be the total amount paid by members in respect of that Organisation since the Organisation last received payment via the Service, less <br><br>(i) any fees due to Payzip under clause 3.2, <br>(ii) any refunds, adjustments, or other amounts paid to members <br>(iii) any chargebacks, reversed or failed payments, <br>(iv) any other amounts owed by the Organisation to Payzip, and <br>(v) any further amount maintained by the Organisation as a reserve under clause 4.2.<br><br>The amount due shall be paid to the Organisation&#x27;s designated bank account with a bank located in the UK (&quot;Organisation&#x27;s Bank Account&quot;) on a Business Day when the automated clearing houses are open for business (Monday through Friday, excluding bank holidays in the United Kingdom).  On occasion, payment may be by paper cheque sent to the Organisation&#x27;s postal address, for instance, if the Organisation&#x27;s bank will not accept an electronic transfer to the Organisation&#x27;s Bank Account.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">A payment made by a member will not be due or payable to an Organisation (or if paid, shall be reimbursed by the Organisation to us), and we will not be liable to the Organisation if:<br>‍<br>a) we, in our sole and absolute discretion, <br>(i) determine that the Organisation has breached the provisions of this agreement and we initiate a refund to the member,<br>(ii) do not permit a transaction or disbursement to proceed where any limit established by us for a security reason would be exceeded, or <br>(iii) permit a member to withdraw from a transaction because the Service is unavailable following the commencement of a transaction;<br><br>b) we discover the payment is erroneous or relates to a duplicate transaction,<br><br>c) the payment is the subject of a chargeback from the member&#x27;s credit card issuer or bank.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">Where reimbursement by the Organisation is required under this clause, without notice to the Organisation we may obtain such reimbursement by<br><br>(i) deducting the amount from the Organisation&#x27;s Reserve in clause 4.4 or any future payments that would otherwise have been owed to the Organisation,<br>(ii) reversing any transfer to the Organisation&#x27;s Bank Account,<br>(iii) charging the Organisation&#x27;s credit card,<br>(iv) collecting payment via direct debit or<br>(iv) seeking such reimbursement from the Organisation by any other lawful means.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">In order to secure the Organisation&#x27;s performance of the potential refund and reimbursement obligations under clause 4, the Organisation agrees to maintain at all times a pending payment amount equal to the sum of the immediately preceding 7 days of sales activity and any pending deductions under clause 4.1 (a &quot;Reserve&quot;).  Payzip may require a higher Reserve, or allow a lower Reserve, as it may determine in its sole and absolute discretion having regard to the rate of chargebacks, refunds, adjustments or other indicators of performance problems related to the Organisation&#x27;s use of the Service, or as may be imposed by any payments processor.  In order to help maintain the Reserve, payments may be made to the Organisation&#x27;s Bank Account on a rolling 7-day cycle (&quot;Payment Date&quot;), based on the first Monday following the Organisation&#x27;s registration.  The Payment Date cannot be changed.  When the Organisation initially provides or later changes his or her Organisation&#x27;s Bank Account information, the Organisation must provide written confirmation, signed by two authorised personnel of the organisation.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 4.4, if we reasonably conclude, based on information available to us, that Organisation&#x27;s actions and/or performance in connection with the Service may result in disputes, chargebacks or other claims, then we may in our sole and absolute discretion delay initiating any remittances and withhold any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to Organisation in connection with the Service or this agreement for the shorter of:<br><br>(a) a period of 90 days following the initial date of suspension; or<br>(b) completion of any investigation(s) regarding any Organisation actions and/or performance in connection with this agreement.</li>

        <ul role="list" class="list-2">
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">A Member must make payments via the Service, using any one of the available payment methods under the terms and conditions published on the Site at the time of submitting the payment request.  After the payment is approved, Payzip will pass the payment onto the Organisation in accordance with the terms of the agreement between Payzip and the Organisation.  The member will resolve any dispute directly with the Organisation.  Any request for a refund should be made directly to the Organisation.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">Payzip sets limits on the amount and number of payments completed through the Service during a set time period for both Members and Organisations.  For security reasons, Payzip does not disclose such limits.  These limits are different from the credit limits set by your credit/debit card issuer.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">Although Payzip does not currently charge Members any fees to use the Service and the Site, it reserves the right to do so in the future.</li>
          <li class="termsconditionsclausebullettext">You promise that you will not use the Service or the Site in the contravention of any applicable law, nor permit or assist others to do so.</li>
