          </ul>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.4.1. User must be able to see coupon/deal/savings information and details before an affiliate cookie is set (i.e. “click here to see coupons and open a window to the Payzip website” is NOT allowed).</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.4.2. Affiliate sites may not have “Click for (or to see) Deal/Coupon” or any variation, when there are no coupons or deals available, and the click opens the Payzip Website or sets a cookie.

          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.4.4. Affiliates may not use misleading text on affiliate links, buttons or images to advertise anything besides currently authorised deals to the specific affiliate. The commercial purpose of the Affiliate’s marketing efforts must be clearly identifiable. The Affiliate shall not disguise its affiliate marketing efforts as consumer recommendations or as similar non-commercial messages.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.5. As a member of the Affiliate Programme, you will be granted access to the Affiliate Dashboard. Here you will have an option to review the details of our Affiliate Programme including our promotional materials, such as affiliate links to web pages within the Payzip Website and banner creatives. You will be free to browse and get tracking codes for our deals if and when they are available. In order for us to accurately keep track of all guest visits from your site to the Payzip Website, you must use the affiliate link that we provide for each banner, text link, HTML code or any other promotional material listed.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.6. Payzip reserves the right, at any time, to review your link placement and either approve or disapprove the use of your affiliate links and require that you change the placement of links or ask you to comply with these guidelines.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.7. The Affiliate is solely responsible for the maintenance and information updates on your site. For example if Payzip’ pricing policy changes, it will be up to the Affiliate to update this information. We may monitor your site as we feel necessary to make sure that it is up-to-date and to notify you of any changes that we feel should enhance your performance.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.8. It is your sole responsibility to follow all applicable laws, regulations, government decrees, authorities’ decisions and the like relating to:</div>

          </ul>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">that pertain to your website or any promotional materials on your website. If you violate any such rules of law or any third party presents any allegations or claims that pertain to information you place on your website and promotional materials you use, you will indemnify and hold Payzip harmless for any and all costs arising out of any such violations, allegations or claims.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.9. As an affiliate, you can only create and use one (1) account. You can list multiple domains within one account, but only one account is allowed.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">2.10. We reserve the right to remove Abandoned Affiliate Accounts from our system if their balance is equal to or less than £10 after a 6 month period of inactivity.

Failure to make the changes to your site that we feel are necessary within reasonable time (no longer than 30 days) constitutes a material breach of this Affiliate Agreement.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">3.2. Payzip reserves the right to terminate your participation in the Affiliate Programme immediately and without prior notice to you if you commit fraud or abuse this Affiliate Programme in any way (including material breaches of section 2.4 of this Affiliate Agreement). If such fraud or abuse is detected, Payzip shall not be liable to you for any Commissions for any fraudulent sales/sales based on abuse.</div>

          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">We may modify, add or remove any of these Terms and Conditions at any point in time. In such event, you will need to comply with a revised version of these Terms and Conditions when prompted to do so in the Affiliate Dashboard. If any modification is unacceptable to you, your only option is to end your association with the Affiliate Programme by closing your account.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">Continued participation in the Affiliate Programme will indicate your agreement to the changes and your adherence to any modified Terms and Conditions.</div>

        <div class="w-layout-grid releasenoteitemgrid affiliatetermsconditions">
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">6.1. Commissions are earned from authorised referrals that generate member card payments via your affiliate links.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">6.2. Commission amounts per card payment may be changed by Payzip at any time. This information is available to you in the Affiliate Dashboard. You are solely responsible for determining if the Commission amount for an affiliate link you have placed on your website has changed or been discontinued.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">6.3. Accrued commissions will be paid weekly following the transaction that generated the commission. No commission payment shall be made unless the total accrued unpaid commissions exceed the minimum threshold of £10. The commission due is calculated in accordance with the statistics and balance that are collected, calculated and displayed on the Affiliate Dashboard. The only valid statistics used for determining Commissions will be those displayed in the Affiliate Dashboard.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">6.4. Affiliate is responsible for any and all charges, fees, taxes, exchange rates, surcharges and other expenses arising out of the Affiliate relationship with Payzip including those incurred in order to receive affiliate payments.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">6.5. All payouts are managed by Stripe, and therefore all Affiliates will need to be approved by Stripe before earned commission can be paid.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">6.6. Payments will only be sent for affiliate card payments that have been successfully completed. Transactions that result in chargebacks or refunds will be void.</div>

        <h3 id="GeneralConditions" class="releaseheading termsconditionsclauseheading">7. Affiliate Promotional Materials</h3>
        <div class="w-layout-grid releasenoteitemgrid affiliatetermsconditions">
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">7.1. You are free to promote what you deem appropriate on your own website(s), but any promotion that mentions Payzip and any associated trademarks may be perceived by the press or the public as a joint effort. You should therefore note that certain forms of advertising are always prohibited by Payzip. Any promotions by Affiliates should never contravene promotional laws in the United Kingdom.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">Advertising commonly known as &quot;spamming&quot; is inappropriate and unacceptable to us and constitutes a material breach of this Affiliate Agreement. Other prohibited forms of advertising include the use of unsolicited commercial email (UCE), postings to non-commercial newsgroups and cross-posting to multiple newsgroups at once. Additionally, you may not advertise in any way that effectively hides or misrepresents your own identity, your domain name, or your email address. You may use emails or other messages to customers to promote Payzip’ services if the recipient is already a customer or subscriber of your services or website, and recipients have the option to remove themselves from future mailings and such emails or other messages are otherwise sent in compliance with the laws applicable to them.</div>
          <div class="releasenoteitemdescription termsconditionstextblock">In any direct marketing messages sent by the Affiliate, the Affiliate must identify itself and its contact details.
